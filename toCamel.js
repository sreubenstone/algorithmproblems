/*
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. 
The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized.

**EXAMPLES**

toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior") // returns "theStealthWarrior"
toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior") // returns "TheStealthWarrior"
*/

function toCamelCase(str) {





}




/*
MY LOGIC

-- split each word into an array delimited by -  e.g., ---> ["the", "stealth", "warrior"]
-- loop through array and modify each index's string to capitalize it starting at position 1
-- join the words together i think this would work
